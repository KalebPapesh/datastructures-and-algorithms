# Hashmaps
 store key-value pairs and allows you to quickly retrieve values by using keys.

## Use cases
1. Data retrieval - quickly look up items by keys rather than having to loop over them like an array
1. Caching - store frequently accessed data and reduce need for costly computations or database queries
1. Counting - couting occurrences of elements in a collection like frequency of words in text
1. Eliminating Duplicates - since hashmaps store key value pairs, you can ensure that there are no duplicates in your collection
1. Graph and Network Routing - represent graphs and optomize routing algorithms by storing connections between nodes

## Algorithms that Use Hashmaps
1. Hashing algorithms - these determine the position of a key in a hashmap
1. Caching algorithms - LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) algorithms often use hashmaps to keep track of requently accessed items
